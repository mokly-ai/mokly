# Browser fixtures

Specs import `test` from `browser_test.ts` or one of its host fixtures. The
automatic fixture fails on unexpected console and page errors. Expected
resource failures need an exact message and URL allowance.

Global setup starts the worker Serve hosts and two copied builds together.
The shared Serve example uses the unresolved base `refs/mokly/browser-suite-no-base`.
It waits for settled usage and unavailable Changes, with one Git diagnostic.
Real Changes specs use their own Git fixtures.
Every host uses a free loopback port. Setup cancels and drains all work on
failure. Teardown closes hosts before it removes their output.

## Current-only copy

`static_test.ts` supplies `test`, `copiedStaticUrl()`, and
`copiedStaticDirectory()`. The URL becomes `baseURL` after global setup.
The directory holds an isolated build of `examples/basic` with Changes
disabled. `MOKLY_PLAYWRIGHT_STATIC_DIR` or `MOKLY_PLAYWRIGHT_FILE_DIR` can
supply that current-only input. Setup rejects an index whose
`changesStatus` is not `disabled`.

## Native comparison copy

`comparison_test.ts` supplies `test`, `copiedComparisonUrl()`,
`copiedComparisonDirectory()`, and `comparisonPaths`. Import its `test` to
use the comparison copy as `baseURL`. Import the URL function when one test
needs both copies. Resolve these functions in a test or hook, after setup.
Tests can read the shared directories but must not change their bytes.

`tests/helpers/comparison_catalogue.ts` writes an isolated repository with
exactly two commits and a `fixture-base` branch. The fixture builds through
the real shim with `--base fixture-base --strict`. It needs no repository
history, network dependency install, or sidecar. The host receives only the
copied output; the source repository and first output are removed.

| `comparisonPaths` key | Entry and evidence                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `changed`             | `screens/changed`: changed text and CSS; a component consumer; a long page and inner scroll region |
| `unchanged`           | `screens/stable`: unchanged and outside Changed membership                                         |
| `component`           | `components/card`: CSS change; Usage links to the changed screen                                   |
| `removedScreen`       | `screens/retired`: historical screen in both viewports and schemes                                 |
| `removedPage`         | `pages/retired`: historical full HTML page                                                         |
| `removedDocument`     | `notes/retired`: historical Markdown document                                                      |
| `removedComponent`    | `components/retired`: removed component parent                                                     |
| `removedVariant`      | `components/card/archived`: removed variant of a surviving component                               |

Read `mokly-viewer/index.json` to get the immutable `comparisonUrl` and each
removed record's `snapshotId`. Use the canonical `/view/{path}/` route and
`snapshot` query when selecting a historical record. The fixture provides
native comparison data for comparison modes, removed previews, Changed
membership, navigation disclosure, focus, scrolling, and stylesheet Details.
Each spec owns its browser state and assertions; the fixture does not mock
read models or alter responses.
