# Mokly Configuration Contract

This is the detailed configuration boundary of the
[package contract](./mokly-package.md). These settings describe current behavior.

## Configuration Discovery

Mokly searches upward from the current working directory for
`mokly.config.ts`, `mokly.config.mts`, `mokly.config.js`, or
`mokly.config.mjs`, unless `--config` is supplied. Discovery stops at the
filesystem root and reports every filename it attempted when none is found.

The config's filesystem paths resolve relative to the config file, never
relative to the installed package or transient npx cache. Repository-matching
globs operate on repo-relative POSIX paths; `publicExclude` uses the
`mockupsDir`-relative matching base specified below. `defineConfig` validates and types
the following contract:

- `mockupsDir`: output/catalogue root, such as `docs/mockups/generated`;
- `entriesDir`: structured `*.mockup.ts` and `*.mockup.tsx` source directory;
- `repoRoot`: repository root, defaulting to the config file's directory;
- a light-only or light-and-dark catalogue rendering set;
- optional renderer-module path and declarative route-to-stylesheet rules;
- optional consumer package roots, aliases, conditions, fields, extensions, and
  loaders for app-owned module resolution;
- default Git base ref used to find the `HEAD` branch point, and internal comparison
  directory;
- shared-impact globs for comparisons;
- additional authored inputs and static assets for watched Serve;
- an optional temporary document transformer for an existing consumer cutover.

The resolved config has one repository root, one mockups root, and normalized
repo-relative POSIX paths. Config validation rejects path traversal, output
outside the repository (including through symlinks), overlapping
authored/generated roots, duplicate rules, and a watch path that cannot be
classified safely.

Before reading Git, `repoRoot` must resolve through symlinks to the same path
as `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` run from that directory. A nested root fails
with `config-invalid`, naming both paths. This validation belongs to config's
Git boundary, not unconditional config loading: build in either output mode,
committed Check and publication without comparisons need no Git repository.
Derived Check requires Git to inspect tracking. Serve's parent, classifier and
HTTP child, comparison export and preview all validate before their first Git
read. All remains usable when history is unavailable; an explicit comparison
request retains the typed configuration error. Missing refs or history keep
their existing command-specific errors.

No default may encode `docs/mockups` as a mandatory location, Accounting route
families, Bookfolio/Firna product tokens, email-template paths, or a TypeScript
workspace layout. A conventional `docs/mockups` layout may be offered by an
explicit initializer or documented example, not hidden in runtime logic.

The normative configuration shape is:

```ts
type ColorScheme = "dark" | "light";

type ModuleLoader =
  | "base64"
  | "binary"
  | "css"
  | "dataurl"
  | "empty"
  | "file"
  | "js"
  | "json"
  | "jsx"
  | "text"
  | "ts"
  | "tsx";

interface MoklyConfig {
  colorSchemes?: readonly ColorScheme[]; // ["light"]
  entriesDir: string;
  generatedOutput?: "committed" | "derived"; // "committed"
  mockupsDir: string;
  publicExclude?: readonly string[]; // extends shipped public exclusions
  repoRoot?: string; // config directory
  renderer?: string;
  moduleResolution?: {
    aliases?: Readonly<Record<string, string>>;
    conditions?: readonly string[];
    loaders?: Readonly<Record<string, ModuleLoader>>;
    mainFields?: readonly string[];
    packageRoots?: readonly string[];
    resolveExtensions?: readonly string[];
  };
  stylesheets?: readonly {
    match: string;
    stylesheets: readonly string[];
    lightStylesheets?: readonly string[];
    darkStylesheets?: readonly string[];
  }[];
  review?: {
    base?: string; // origin/main; merge base with HEAD
    baselineBuild?: readonly (readonly string[])[]; // derived mode only
    outDir?: string; // .context/mokly-review
    sharedImpact?: readonly string[];
  };
  watch?: {
    debounceMs?: number; // 75
    rules?: readonly {
      action: "ignore" | "rebuild" | "reload" | "restart";
      paths: readonly string[];
    }[];
  };
  compatibility?: {
    readManifestV2?: boolean; // false
    transformer?: string;
  };
}
```

Filesystem fields (`repoRoot`, `entriesDir`, `mockupsDir`, `renderer`,
compatibility transformer, module-resolution package
roots, and Review `outDir`) are config-relative. Stylesheet file paths are
relative to `mockupsDir`; HTTP(S) stylesheet URLs are allowed.
`colorSchemes` is a non-empty, duplicate-free subset of `"light" | "dark"`
that must include `"light"`; it defaults to `["light"]` and normalizes to
light-first order. Shared `stylesheets` apply to every generated view, with a
matching `lightStylesheets` or `darkStylesheets` list appended in declaration
order.
`generatedOutput` defaults to `"committed"`; `"derived"` and the derived-only
`review.baselineBuild` argv list follow the
[derived baselines contract](./mokly-derived-baselines.md).
`baselineBuild` is invalid in committed mode, including a staged migration;
enable a repository-specific recipe together with the derived mode switch.
Derived Check accepts absent local generated output, rejects Git-tracked routes,
the manifest and cache files, and prints their paths plus ignore guidance.
Build writes transactionally in both modes. Serve and export await preparation
before classification; Serve publishes `preparing` when a rebuild is needed,
then `pending` while classification runs. Cache hits skip `preparing`.
`watch.rules[].paths` and Review `sharedImpact` are repository-relative POSIX
globs, while stylesheet `match` matches catalogue routes. `repoRoot` defaults to the config directory. Duplicate stylesheet
matches and watch paths are invalid. Additional watch rules cannot override
configured source/module rebuilds, reloads for configured stylesheets and
referenced resources, or package-owned ignores for dependency, build, test, Review, header-proven
generated, and transaction paths. An unowned public HTML file below
`mockupsDir` remains consumer-authored and can match an explicit watch rule.
The repository's `.mokly-cache/` and its physical aliases are always private
and ignored before source exceptions or broad globs, and cannot be configured
as entries, mockups, Review output, or an export destination.
For a repository-root config, recommend `entriesDir: "docs/mockups/entries"`,
`mockupsDir: "docs/mockups/generated"`, and `renderer: "docs/mockups/renderer.tsx"`.
Public assets live under `generated`; README and tsconfig files can live beside
it with the renderer and entry sources. This sibling layout avoids mixing
publication output with developer files.
Authored source directories may sit below `mockupsDir` for a `docs/mockups/src`
layout, but they may not equal each other or the output root; generated routes
are collision-checked against those sources before writing. Review output must
not overlap a source or output root in either direction. That rule applies
to configured comparison output and the transactional writer boundary. The
[npm CLI](./mokly-package.md#cli) has no Review command or output override; the repository-only
[preview builder](./mokly-publication.md#publication-option) separately accepts
`--out` for its published catalogue. Export's
required `--out` has the additional source/runtime/ownership confinement rules
in the [export contract](./mokly-export.md).

`review.sharedImpact` is fallback impact evidence for files the rendered resource
graph cannot see, such as renderer, component-source, or token modules. Linked
stylesheets, including transitive imports, are attributed by rule under
[CSS change attribution](./mokly-css-attribution.md). A changed stylesheet keeps
a view's dependency evidence only when a changed rule could match its before or
after document, or analysis is unresolved. Otherwise it is examined and excluded.
Shared-impact globs cannot override this exclusion or add unreferenced public
files to Changes; they retain the existing ownership and membership rules in
[Changes](./mokly-changes.md) and [component attribution](./mokly-component-changes.md).

`moduleResolution` has no defaults beyond esbuild's platform behavior. Package
roots must be in-repository directories containing `package.json`; their
`node_modules` directories supplement consumer lookup. Aliases accept bare
package specifiers only. Conditions, package fields, and extensions are ordered,
deduplicated lists, while loader keys are extensions and values are supported
esbuild loader names. React and React DOM still resolve through Mokly's
consumer-peer plugin so these options cannot introduce a second React runtime.

The `legacy` config key is rejected, including `legacy: undefined`. Register
complete documents explicitly with `definePage` or nested `page`, following the
[source-preserving migration](./mokly-page-migration.md). Historical manifest
compatibility does not restore source discovery or legacy configuration.

## Public Exclusion Configuration

`publicExclude?: readonly string[]` extends the defaults in the
[source-protection contract](./mokly-source-protection.md#public-exclusions):
`**/README`, `**/README.*`, `**/tsconfig.json`, and `**/tsconfig.*.json`.
The defaults are case-folded, so consumers need not add case variants.
Resolution prepends them to consumer entries without
mutating the input; omission and an empty array produce the defaults alone.
The resolved list is frozen. Watched children require this already-resolved
array and use the shared glob validator to adopt a frozen copy with exactly
the transferred entries, without prepending defaults again. Missing, non-array
or unsafe values reject the startup message. Repeated globs are harmless and
do not fail config.

Validate the array and each string at config load. A safe relative POSIX glob
is nonempty and contains no absolute/drive/UNC prefix, backslash,
colon, NUL/control character, or empty, `.` or `..` path segment. Reject
whitespace-only strings, leading `!` negation, and leading `#` comment syntax.
Use the repository's minimatch glob syntax; any brace-expanded alternative must
also satisfy those path rules. Invalid input fails with the typed `config-invalid`
error naming `publicExclude` and the offending item, before publication or serving.

Match the whole candidate path relative to `mockupsDir`, not relative to
`repoRoot` or the config directory, with case-insensitive and dotfile matching.
For example, `publicExclude: ["internal/**"]` hides that directory's contents
under `mockupsDir` in addition to every shipped default. Realpath aliases and
all public-resource boundaries use the same source-protection policy.
