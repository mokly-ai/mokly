# Redact literal percent signs in secrets

- **Severity:** Low. **Effort:** Small.
- **Kind:** Needs decision.
- **Added:** 2026-10-29, from PR #199 and the completed Rust rebuild plan.
- **Location:** See the affected paths in the task below.
- **Reason:** PR #199 merged before this work. The completed plan is now being removed.

## Task

Resolve user item 177 (delta review 2):
`crates/mokly-publish/src/redaction.rs:85`: `SecretMatcher` reads every
`%` as an escape, so it does not redact the literal form of a secret
that contains `%`. The old redactor did. A valid token cannot contain
`%`. Severity Low, security, effort not recorded. Options (estimate):
A, also match a literal `%` byte; B, keep it and document that a token
cannot contain `%`. Recommended: A.

## Decision

- **Source:** Review.
- **Category:** security.
- **Background:** The Task section preserves the completed plan's context, evidence, and recorded options.
- **Problem:** The completed plan left this item open.
- **Impact if no action:** The recorded defect, risk, or process gap remains until the user selects an option.
- **Root question:** How should Mokly redact literal percent signs in secrets?
- **Options:**
  - **A.** Use option A from the Task section. Effort: Small.
  - **B.** Use option B from the Task section. Effort: Small.
- **Left out:** The completed plan found no third distinct implementation beyond the recorded direct and wider approaches.
- **Wider fix:** A.
- **Previous examples:** The completed plan record linked below.
- **Recommendation:** A. The Task section records this recommendation.
- **Action:** ask the user, because condition 5 holds. The user deferred this item for a later decision.
