# Make pnpm recreation independent of CI

- **Severity:** Medium. **Effort:** Small.
- **Kind:** Needs decision.
- **Added:** 2026-10-29, from PR #199 and the completed Rust rebuild plan.
- **Location:** See the affected paths in the task below.
- **Reason:** PR #199 merged before this work. The completed plan is now being removed.

## Task

Resolve user item 158 (pnpm CI fix finding 1): pnpm recreates a
tracked `node_modules` only under CI. A tracked
`node_modules/.modules.yaml` that needs recreation fails locally with
`ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY`, which gives tier three,
but succeeds under CI, which gives tier two. Severity Medium, product
bug, effort Small. Options: A, turn off the recreation prompt for
private installs, Small; B, document the CI-dependent result, effort
not recorded. Recommended: A.

## Decision

- **Source:** Review.
- **Category:** product bug.
- **Background:** The Task section preserves the completed plan's context, evidence, and recorded options.
- **Problem:** The completed plan left this item open.
- **Impact if no action:** The recorded defect, risk, or process gap remains until the user selects an option.
- **Root question:** How should Mokly make pnpm recreation independent of CI?
- **Options:**
  - **A.** Use option A from the Task section. Effort: Small.
  - **B.** Use option B from the Task section. Effort: Small.
- **Left out:** The completed plan found no third distinct implementation beyond the recorded direct and wider approaches.
- **Wider fix:** A.
- **Previous examples:** The completed plan record linked below.
- **Recommendation:** A. The Task section records this recommendation.
- **Action:** ask the user, because condition 5 holds. The user deferred this item for a later decision.
