# Store the install-scripts mode in one place

- **Severity:** Low. **Effort:** Medium.
- **Kind:** Needs decision.
- **Added:** 2026-10-29, from PR #199 and the completed Rust rebuild plan.
- **Location:** See the affected paths in the task below.
- **Reason:** PR #199 merged before this work. The completed plan is now being removed.

## Task

Resolve user item 155 (135 B review finding 51): the scripts mode is
stored in several places. Severity Low. Recommended: B, keep the mode
on the install command. The 135 B review record holds the other
options.

The full historical record is in the [Rust rebuild plan at the commit before deletion](https://github.com/mokly-ai/mokly/blob/f93afceaa1d94de3526c4825cc11708c951678ba/plans/rust-rebuild.md?plain=1#L6145).
